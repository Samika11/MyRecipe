1. Wash your strawberries and cut off the leafy part.
2. Fill your chocolate or chocolate chips into your microwave-safe bowl. Microwave it for 1 minute and 10 second intervals after that if it's still not melted.
3. Take your strawberries and slowly dip them into the chocolate, covering as much as you can.
4. Line the parchment paper on top of the plate or pan and place the strawberries face-down.
5. Place it in the freezer until hardened.
6. Enjoy!
